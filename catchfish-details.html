            <h5>VisionOS app created with Swift</h5>
            <p>This project was created for a semester-long capstone class, where my group was tasked with creating an app for the Apple Vision Pro. We decided to create a casual fishing game. I took on the role of sole app developer in the group and coded the entire project using SwiftUI and XCode.</p>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
              <h4>The Assignment</h4>
              <p>The assignment was to create an app built for the apple vision pro. My team was given full control over what we built and how we built it. We decided to create a fishing game, as that combined many of our interests of playing games and would allow us to showcase our team's individual abilities, such as development, 3D modeling, and music creation. The final deliverables included the app as our main product, a booth presentation, final stage presentation, project website, and project trailer. As the developer in the group, my main role in the project was working on the app itself.</p>

              <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
              <p>CatchFish was built in Xcode, natively for the Apple Vision Pro. Created with Swift programming language, specifically for the VisionOS operating system, with SwiftUI, RealityKit, and UIKit.</p>
            <h3>My Role and Contribution</h3>
              <h4>Sole App Developer</h4>
              <p>I was the only app developer on the project. The app was created prior to the apple vision pro's release. This project led me to being very comfortable with reading code documentation.</p>
              <p>As the only developer, I had a very critical role, and it was vital I stayed organized and on track with the development timeline. I created a trello board to track every feature that my team and I decided to implement, to ensure every feature got implemented on time.</p>

                    <figcaption>Mid-semester screenshot of Trello board used by me to stay on track with every feature needed to be implemented.</figcaption>
              <h4>Team Lead</h4>
              <p>As team leader, I made sure the team stayed on track with deliverables at each semester checkpoint.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Developed project timeline</li>
                <li>Monitored progress</li>
                <li>Ensured quality from all group members</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
              <h4>Animating the pond</h4>
                <p>The background of the pond is an animated gif, created by one of my team members in Adobe After Effects. It took a lot of trial and error to make sure that the background looked good, while making sure the file size was not too large so the app ran smoothly.</p>
                <p>On a z-layer above the pond, is an animated fish that "swims" across the screen. The app first checks if the game is paused. If it is not paused, the fish starts moving across the screen on a timer interval and easeInEaseOut animations, from its current x and y position towards its goal x and y position. If the bobber and the fish's paths cross, the fish stops moving and the timer is paused, and the bobber's depth gets lowered, which gives it a sinking effect. This then triggers the fishing mini game and resets the fish to a new position.</p>

                <h4>Catching the fish mini game</h4>
                <p>Once the user pinches a bobber that is over a fish in the water, it triggers a mini game, where a rectangle moves up and down, and the user must pinch a button when the rectangle and a circle are overlapping. Once the fish is caught, it is added to an array storing all of the caught fish.</p>

              <h4>Storing the fish</h4>
              <p>The caught fish are stored in an array within FishList, an observable object. Observable objects are a swiftUI objects that allow for updates that effect the UI, so this allows the journal to properly update when the fish array is updated. The user has the ability to view all caught fish in the fish object view, where they can sort the fish, rename the fish, and favorite specific fish.</p>

              <h4>Navigating the app</h4>
              <p>To navigate the app, I implemented a TabView object. For the navigation bar, I followed Apple Human Interface guidelines to ensure best practices and experience for the user.</p>
            <h3>THE FINAL PRODUCT</h3>
            <p>With the core features and graphics of the app done, it was time to add some final details. To the archive, I added a sorting feature. I also added music and sound effects throughout the app to make it more captivating. This project taught me a lot about developing a native app for Apple products, and I look forward to using everything I learned when creating future apps.</p>

            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>With the Apple Vision Pro being an unreleased product, we knew that there would be few apps available with the product with the release. Our team wanted to create something unique that we knew wouldn’t already exist for the device. This is why we decided to create a casual fishing app with a fun, yet relaxing environment.</p>
            <h3>the solution</h3>
            <p>With the idea of a casual fishing game in mind, I began working on development. While I had previously created iOS apps in XCode, VisionOS and 3D elements were completely new territory for me. I started by creating a simple view with a blue background and a 2D fish that moved across the screen by randomly generating two coordinates and the fish moving from one to the other. When the user tapped on the fish, a fish was added to the archive, where the user could see all of the fish they had caught.</p>
            <div class="portfolio-details-container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <img src="assets/img/portfolio/Ponder4.png" alt="Inspiration board image">
                    <figcaption>Original pond screen</figcaption>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <img src="assets/img/portfolio/Ponder5.png" alt="Inspiration board image">
                    <figcaption>Original fish gallery view</figcaption>
                </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Next, I focused on making the game more captivating. I added a bobber to the water, and the user was now only able to catch fish if the fish was under the bobber. To add a challenging aspect to the game, I added a bar off to the side, and when the user caught a fish, they now had to align a moving bar with a circle to reel in the fish. I also added a feature where for every 5 fish that the user catches, a new type of fish is unlocked and a new challenges view.</p>

            <p>Finally, I added the graphics to the game. With the help of my group, we created a moving water background, a 3-dimensional bobber, and 3-dimensional fish.</p>

            <h3>THE FINAL PRODUCT</h3>
            <p>With the core features and graphics of the app done, it was time to add some final details. To the archive, I added a sorting feature. I also added music and sound effects throughout the app to make it more captivating. This project taught me a lot about developing a native app for Apple products, and I look forward to using everything I learned when creating future apps.</p>
