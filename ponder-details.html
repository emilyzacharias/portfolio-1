              <h2>Creating a playful fishing game for the Apple Vision Pro</h2>
              <h3>Project Overview</h3>
              <p>
                This project was created for a semester-long capstone class, where my group was tasked with creating an app for the Apple Vision Pro. We decided to create a casual fishing game. I took on the sole role of developer in the group and coded the entire project using SwiftUI and XCode.
              </p>
              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p>
                With the Apple Vision Pro being an unreleased product, we knew that there would be few apps available with the product with the release. Our team wanted to create something unique that we knew wouldn’t already exist for the device. This is why we decided to create a casual fishing app with a fun, yet relaxing environment.
              </p>
              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>
                With the idea of a casual fishing game in mind, I began working on development. While I had previously created iOS apps in XCode, VisionOS and 3D elements were completely new territory for me. I started by creating a simple view with a blue background and a 2D fish that moved across the screen by randomly generating two coordinates and the fish moving from one to the other. When the user tapped on the fish, a fish was added to the archive, where the user could see all of the fish they had caught.
              </p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 3.09.30 PM.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              <p>Next, I focused on making the game more captivating. I added a bobber to the water, and the user was now only able to catch fish if the fish was under the bobber. To add a challenging aspect to the game, I added a bar off to the side, and when the user caught a fish, they now had to align a moving bar with a circle to reel in the fish. I also added a feature where for every 5 fish that the user catches, a new type of fish is unlocked and a new challenges view.</p>
              <p>Finally, I added the graphics to the game. With the help of my group, we created a moving water background, a 3-dimensional bobber, and 3-dimensional fish.</p>

              <h3>The Results</h3>
              <p>With the core features and graphics of the app done, it was time to add some final details. To the archive, I added a sorting feature. I also added music and sound effects throughout the app to make it more captivating. This project taught me a lot about developing a native app for Apple products, and I look forward to using everything I learned when creating future apps.</p>
