              <h2>Weekly menu generating app for iOS</h2>
              <h3>Project Overview</h3>
              <p>
                I was inspired to make this project because, as a college student, I am still new to living on my own and making my own meals, and I never know what to make for dinner. The purpose of my app is to give a random list of recipes for the user to make, as well as a shopping list to make the grocery store trip easy. This app was made for my final project for Native App Development at UGA, and I used XCode and swiftUI to make it.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was the biggest project I have done with app development, which lead to a lot of challenges. From designing the user-interface, to turning out a finished product with fully functioning features, I had to spend a lot of time trying different methods and redoing portions of the app to make it work. A lot of components of the app are made with arrays, which were a big challenge to me during this project. Using arrays in Swift is a lot different than every other programming language Iâ€™ve learned, and even just turning the array into text on the screen involved me following a few different tutorials.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make my app as user-friendly as it could be, I spent a long time working on using familiar gestures to navigate the app. I added a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, where the icons grow and change color when clicked and I added support for different gestures in the app. In the browse screen, the user can easily scroll between different recipes in the app and swipe to the left to favorite them and return to them later in the saved tab. For the recipes generated for the user, the user can easily swipe down to refresh them and generate new recipes. To see a detailed view of any recipe, the user can click on the recipe to pull up a modal view of it. The user can also easily navigate to the preferences screen, where they can filter out certain food groups from the generated recipes, as well as change the number of generated recipes.
              </p>
              <p>
                My app is fully functional, but there are a lot of features I would like to add in later updates, such as using core data to store the saved recipes and connecting to an API to add more recipes to the app. I learned a lot while making this app that I hope to bring into future apps that I create.
